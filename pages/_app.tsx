  to persist elements between routes for an app-like feel, we need to use nested 
  layouts, which is not super intuitive in Next.js and has some limitations.

  this has been solved with nested routing (credit to Remix) once app dir is 
  out of beta we will be able to use this feature for an app-like feel ðŸŽ‰.

  our app makes use of API calls using functions called on the server rather 
  than fetching data from the client - we could either refactor to fetch data
  from the client, but SPA-like behaviour could impact SEO (?). 
  On the server we can also control hits to the api / database, which if 
  executed on the client would be lost.

  TODO play more and test. Next.js offers a lot of flexibility.
